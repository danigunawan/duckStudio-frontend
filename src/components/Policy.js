        <p>Duck Studio online store was created as part of a final Project at Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp.
        While it has all the main functionalities working, there is still so much room for improvement, so bugs should not surprise you! 
        Therefore if you're willing to buy at Duck, please note the following and buy at your own risk:
        - selected duck color is not guaranteed;
        - all prices are real;
        - payment are being processed via Stripe, and no Customer CC data is being stored on our servers;
        - no returns or refunds;
        - US shipping only.
        </p> 
    </div>
